              " 'All of us will do our best without stopping for sustainable growth and development. First of all, I would like to convey my sincere appreciation to our stakeholders for continued affection and trust. In the last year, we were able to reinforce our core competency and competitiveness under  he motto of ¡®new Kumho Asiana¡¯. These achievements were made possible because of the assionnd unwavering focus which we learned in our early years. We chose ¡®Flawless Operational Safety¡¯ and ¡®Regaining Customer Trust¡¯ as our top priorities because safety and service are Asiana Airlines¡¯ highest goals. We¡¯ve made improvements in flight training system and maintenance quality system to reinforce our general safety systems. Aisana Airlines has introduced A380, the next generation cutting-edge aircraft, to provide convenience for customers and put them into lA flights. In order to reinforce the competitiveness of long-haul flights, we  expanded Paris and Istanbul flights. Furthermore, we added more flights to Guangzhou, yanji and Shenzhen to take the dominance as a leading carrier in the Chinese market. Asiana Airlines has laid the groundwork for sustainability with the revitalization of organizational culture. ¡®Smile brings blessings¡¯ campaign, the meeting between executives and staffers which leads to frank exchanges of opinions, has given us the sense of belonging and strong bond by tearing down the walls between positions. Asiana Airlines is going to fulfill the management policy of the last year, new Kumho Asiana, in 2015 and will try its best to be a reliable and beautiful company under the new motto ¡°Strengthen Self without Stopping¡±. That means we are ready to stand as one and work tirelessly for the steady development and growth of the company. In addition to the safety and service items we have already promoted, an integrated safety information system will be built and bold investment for hi-tech operation equipment will be made to continuously strengthen the infrastructure for safety. This will also enhance the foundation for bringing about the awareness of safety issues. In order to reinforce our competitiveness through the latest aircraft, we confirmed the plan to introduce A350XWb and A321 nEO. We hope this will help build up the foundation for future growth. This year, we will put additional A380s into new york flights and will start a new flight to Rome to reinforce our competitiveness in long-haul flight. Also, we will speed up the plan to add our strategic air routes in China and other Asian countries. Asiana Airlines hopes to become a company that contributes to the nation and society by social and environmental activities. We are going to take responsibility for social and environmental issues with persistence and sincerity. One of such efforts is the ¡®unICEF Spare Coin Collection¡¯ which we has been working with the Korean Committee for unICEF (united nations Children¡¯s Fund). In the last year, the accumulated amount of money has exceeded 10 billion won. This fundraising campaign will be continued for the benefit of underprivileged children. There are also other activities and campaigns to promote corporate responsibility such as ¡®Social Work Volunteering In Relay¡¯, ¡®beautiful Classroom¡¯ in China, tree planting events on the reclaimed lands near metropolitan areas and various environmental activities to reduce greenhouse gases. In retrospect, Asiana Airlines has grown and evolved thanks to our stakeholders¡¯ continuous affection and support. We will make utmost efforts to raise the corporate value to the best in the business and to be a ¡®beautiful Company¡¯who is willing to take the social responsibilities by raising awareness of safety issues and differentiating the services with distinct ideas. We hope all our stakeholders will favor us with supports and expectations. Thank you.\\nSoo Cheon, Kim\\nPresident & CEO')"

To our stakeholders, During the past 67 years, AMOREPACIFIC has embarked on a long journey of beauty to provide happiness and pleasure to people all around the world with AMOREPACIFIC¡¯s creation of beauty products. We have stood the test of numerous crises resulting from uncertain management conditions to achieve continuous growth by caring about our customers and taking quick actions to seek new opportunities. Even at this very moment, AMOREPACIFIC is striving to satisfy global customers by discovering the values of sustainable beauty found in Asia¡¯s profound wisdom, while also making concerted efforts to create a sustainable company. AMOREPACIFIC has minimized the negative impacts on the environment and strengthened the development of sustainable products and packaging materials to deliver the values of environment-friendly consumption to customers. We continually expanded the Beautiful Fair Trade to acquire outstanding local raw materials and support the local communities and concentrated the corporate competency on developing eco-friendly packages that used botanical raw materials and recycled materials. Also, the AMOREPACIFIC beauty production site equipped with production and logistics systems of global standards acquired the certifications for eco-friendly building and CGMP (Cosmetics Good Manufacturing Practice) and we constructed a botanical garden of raw materials, which is an environment-friendly natural park. Based on these efforts, we will become a beauty creator to the world by providing high-quality products with the best raw materials for our customers and contributing to the environment and local communities. The global brand company that AMOREPACIFIC is seeking to achieve will be realized by talented people who are ready to challenge on the world stage. Therefore, AMOREPACIFIC has worked towards developing the global competencies of employees based on its management philosophy of valuing people above everything else and creating a workplace where employees can grow as individuals. Through the Smart Work and Happy Plus campaigns, we increased employee engagement to be more devoted to customers and helped find a balance between work and personal life. Also, we consolidate the dreams and vocations of a variety of talented employees into one by implementing a corporate culture activity of One AMOREPACIFIC from a global perspective. AMOREPACIFIC has continually strengthened a win-win relationship with business partners to create a healthy business ecosystem. To strengthen the competitiveness of business partners, we expanded the Supplier Support Fund for suppliers and opened a win-win portal site for suppliers to effectively resolve complaints from business partners. As a result, AMOREPACIFIC and its business partners will maintain a beautiful relationship where they will help each other to achieve growth. Furthermore, in order to fulfill our responsibility as a global citizen, we support the ten principles of UN Global Compact (UNGC), including human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption. We will continually work towards reflecting these principles in AMOREPACIFIC¡¯s management activities. To our stakeholders, The management policy of AMOREPACIFIC for 2013 is ¡®TEAM Together¡¯. It shows AMOREPACIFIC¡¯s commitment to look from the apex of where two points meet together instead of dividing the world into what is mine and others, thereby walking side by side with our partners in the business ecosystem, including suppliers. Furthermore, if we walk together with the world and the society, we can grow much faster and healthier. AMOREPACIFIC has the dream of changing the world with our beauty products.
